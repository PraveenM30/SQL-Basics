#WHERE keyword : is used to filter records and specify the conditions that must be met for the rows to be included in the result set of a query.
select * from exam_Results where student_id=10;
 
 
#AND : is a logical operator used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause. It allows you to filter records that satisfy all of the 
       specified conditions. When you use AND, every condition must be true for the row to be included in the result set.
select * from exam_Results where student_id=10 and exam_id=1;

#OR : operator is used to combine multiple conditions in a WHERE clause, but unlike AND, it returns results where at least one of the conditions
      is true.
select * from exam_Results where student_id=10 or student_id=11;

#AND & OR
select * from exam_results where (student_Id=11 and gender='female') or gender='male';

#in : operator is used to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. It's a shorthand way of writing multiple OR conditions, making the 
       query cleaner and easier to read.
select * from exam_results where gender in('male','female');

#BETWEEN : Operator in SQL is used to filter records within a range of values.
select * from exam_results where student_id between 11 and 13;

#NOT BETWEEN : operator in SQL is used to filter records that do not fall within a specified range.
select * from exam_results where student_id not between 11 and 13;
